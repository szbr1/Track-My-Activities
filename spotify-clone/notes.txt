2. if issue so mention the issue
what things you focus:
1. don't try to imporove the code to look good 
2. if there is any problem in the code so just tell me the mistake or mention the mistake lately

4. remeber i don't like extra nonsense and i don't like reading lenghty paragraph type answers

You have this code.

Your job:

Check if the code will run or not.

If the code runs but causes issues at any point (like a crash, error, or wrong behavior), clearly mention what the issue is and where exactly it will stop me — give a practical example like "if you click the search icon, it will crash because..."

If there’s a problem, mention the exact mistake too.

Important focus:

Don’t try to improve the code’s style, structure, or readability.

If the code works without breaking, no suggestions or fixes needed.

If there’s a problem or bug, mention it clearly — no improvements or code rewriting.

I’m learning by spotting mistakes, so only help me catch errors.

No extra explanations, no long paragraphs.

Answer format should be:

Will it run: Yes / No

If no, issue is: (mention issue)

If yes but causes issue later: (explain what issue and where it will happen with a practical example)
