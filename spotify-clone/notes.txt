let's test your skill just tell me this here is the code you have  what you will check 
1. code will run or not
2. if issue so mention the issue
what things you focus:
1. don't try to imporove the code to look good 
2. if there is any problem in the code so just tell me the mistake or mention the mistake lately
3. i am learing and learn from problems my goal is to check does the code will work or not i don't want you suggestion for imporvement if code is working even with this 
4. remeber i don't like extra nonsense and i don't like reading lenghty paragraph type answers
